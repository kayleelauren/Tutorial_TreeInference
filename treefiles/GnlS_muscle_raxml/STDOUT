RAxML can't, parse the alignment file as phylip file 
it will now try to parse it as FASTA file



IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences Haemophilus_influenzae_F3031_uid62123 and Haemophilus_influenzae_F3047_uid62097 are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences Haemophilus_influenzae_86_028NP_uid58093 and Haemophilus_influenzae_Rd_KW20_uid57771 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 2 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file infile.txt.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs"
