Initial topology in 0.00 seconds
Refining topology: 10 rounds ME-NNIs, 2 rounds ME-SPRs, 5 rounds ML-NNIs
Total branch-length 0.016 after 0.00 sec
ML-NNI round 1: LogLk = -560.218 NNIs 2 max delta 0.00 Time 0.02
Switched to using 20 rate categories (CAT approximation)
Rate categories were divided by 0.626 so that average rate = 1.0
CAT-based log-likelihoods may not be comparable across runs
Use -gamma for approximate but comparable Gamma(20) log-likelihoods
ML-NNI round 2: LogLk = -559.591 NNIs 2 max delta 0.00 Time 0.06
Turning off heuristics for final round of ML NNIs (converged)
ML-NNI round 3: LogLk = -559.591 NNIs 2 max delta 0.00 Time 0.08 (final)
Optimize all lengths: LogLk = -559.591 Time 0.09
