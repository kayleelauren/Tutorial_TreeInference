Initial topology in 0.05 seconds
Refining topology: 10 rounds ME-NNIs, 2 rounds ME-SPRs, 9 rounds ML-NNIs
      0.22 seconds: ME NNI round 4 of 10, 1 of 19 splits
      0.40 seconds: ME NNI round 7 of 10, 1 of 19 splits
Total branch-length 0.979 after 0.41 sec
      0.67 seconds: ML NNI round 1 of 9, 1 of 19 splits
ML-NNI round 1: LogLk = -8847.509 NNIs 2 max delta 0.38 Time 1.23
      1.24 seconds: Site likelihoods with rate category 1 of 20
      1.37 seconds: Site likelihoods with rate category 6 of 20
      1.49 seconds: Site likelihoods with rate category 11 of 20
      1.61 seconds: Site likelihoods with rate category 16 of 20
Switched to using 20 rate categories (CAT approximation)
Rate categories were divided by 0.699 so that average rate = 1.0
CAT-based log-likelihoods may not be comparable across runs
Use -gamma for approximate but comparable Gamma(20) log-likelihoods
